# AutoLeague3

*AutoLeague3 is currently in beta and adds support for RLBot v5. See [AutoLeague2](https://github.com/NicEastvillage/AutoLeague2) for RLBot v4.*

AutoLeague3 is a tool for running competitive leagues with custom Rocket League bots using the [RLBot framework](http://rlbot.org/).
Microsoft's [TrueSkill](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/trueskill-ranking-system/) ranking system is used to rate the bots.
AutoLeague automates the process of selecting fair teams, starting matches, and rating the bots.
It also ensures that every bot gets to play regularly.

## V3 TODO

* Move default match config to league folder such that the user can use it for launcher settings and match settings
* Add logo to Psyonix bots
* Rename setup command to settings
* Allow bots to be stored elsewhere, symlink?
* Mercy rule
* Refactor the league model and merge the `bubblesort` branch
* Make autoleague installable on cli

## How to use

Setup:
* Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [RLBot v5](http://rlbot.org/).
* Install autoleague's dependencies `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* Run `autoleague.py setup league <"path/to/my/league/">` to create a league in the given directory.
* Add some bots to `path/to/my/league/bots/`.

Usage:
* Check if autoleague3 can find the bots with `autoleague.py bot list`.
* Optionally, start the RLBot v5 Launcher if you want RLBot output in another console.
* Test if a bot works with `autoleague.py bot test <bot_id>`.
* Run `autoleague.py match run` or `autoleague.py match prepare` to run a match.
* Terminate matches without risk using `ctrl+C`.
* Change rlbot settings and match settings such as Steam/Epic launcher and mutators in `src/resources/default_match_config.toml`
* See all commands further down.

Extra:
* The folder `src/resources/overlay/` contains various overlays showing the state of the league and current match. Most notably:
  * `summary.html` shows the leaderboard and the latest matches. Update the latter using `autoleague.py summary [n]`.
  * `ingame_leaderboard.html` shows only the leaderboard.
  * `overlay.html` shows the currently playing bots in two banners near the top.
  * `versus_logos.html` shows the play bots and their logos on a big versus screen.

  You can show these overlays on stream using a browser source in OBS.

The entire state of the league is stored in the folder `path/to/my/league/`, which allows it to be sent and shared with others.

### East's League play

I use AutoLeague3 for [East's League Play](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PzZ3UgBp36RO7V6iiXN3AnLioDUAW9jwgHpZXiFuvIg/edit#). The league play is split in weeks, and each week I do the following steps:

* Before stream:
  * Make sure `path/to/my/league` is up-to-date
  * Delete the old submission folder `path/to/my/league/bots/` and unzip the new one
  * Unzip all bots using the command `autoleague.py bot unzip`
  * Check if `autoleague.py bot list` shows all the bots I expect
  * Test all updated/new bots using `autoleague.py bot test <bot_id>`. If a is bot misbehaving, I send a message to the creator explaining the issue and delete the bot's config in the `path/to/my/league/bots/`. This will prevent it from playing.
  * Run `autoleague.py summary` to reset the summary shown by the overlay

* During stream:
  * Run `autoleague.py match run` to run a single match. Overlays, tickets, mmr, summary, and more updates automatically.
    * Alternatively, `autoleague.py match prepare` prepares the next match and updates overlays, but it doesn't start without confirmation.
  * If needed, a match can be undone using `autoleague.py match undo`.
